# Instructions to run final code

For the most part it should be run in cell order. The kernel will die everytime the environment is rendered so after rendering an environment the code must be run again from the start or all dependencies must be imported again.


I have used additional libraries like optuna, os, opencv which werent in the original environment.
make sure to install those before running.
